"He is brilliant in his field, but expects his students to perform at high levels, with unrealistic expectations. Only by a miracle did I get an A, and that was after a heavy curve.

He has a major in philosophy which is why all the papers you have to write are based on philosophy. As long as your paper agrees with what he thinks you will get a good grade.

"I recently just finished taking Comp 110 with Rand and it was the hardest class of my freshman semester.

Bottom line Rand needs to retire before he ruins everyone's GPA's.  He thinks he knows so much about English and thinks it is his job to make essay assignments unneeded riddles.

Horrible teacher. Smart guy. Very confusing when he lectures. He jumps around and is very scatter brained.
